This file details configuration options that may be activated.

* ICONS/TEXT
    Actions for an entry (edit, delete, get ps, ps.gz, pdf ...) are available
in both text format or icons. By default, icons are displayed. This can be
modified by editing the config.php file and changing these two variables:

$display_images = TRUE;
$display_text = FALSE;


* ABSTRACT
By default, abstract are not displayed. If you browser supports javascript,
clicking on the abstract link or icons will show it in the same page. If the
browser doesn't support javascript, a new page will be open to display the 
abstract.

To always show abstract, change the value of $display_abstract to TRUE in the
config.php file.

* AUTHENTICATION
If you want to share your bibliography within a local network, you may not want
other people to edit or even delete your data. A simple authentication is
available with biborb to manage authorized "admin" users. Unauthorized visitor 
may consult bibliographies but won't be able to modify it.

You will need a database and adapt the different variables in the config.php
file:

$disable_authentication = FALSE;
$host = xxx;
$dbuser = xxx;
$pass = xxxx;
$db = xxxx;
$table = xxxx;

biborb.sql in admin directory contains SQL instructions to create the needded
table. You then have to add manually users to the database.



* CSS LOOKING
The CSS file style.css contains formatting data for BibORB. The user interface 
is managed using CSS so, it would not be difficult to CSS hackers to change 
entirely the looking of BibORB.

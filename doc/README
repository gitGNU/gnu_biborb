DESCRIPTION
-----------

This tool aims to provide a web-based interface to BibTeX
bibliographies and electronic version of papers.
A 'group' facility has been introduced to create a simple classement
method.
It supports search over titles, authors and keywords.

It is based on:
	* BibTeX
		To provide an input format for references.
	* XML
		To provide an easier input format for manipulating the
references.
	* XSLT
		To transform in any needed format the references.
	* CSS
		Some nice web design :-) .
	* PHP
		To link every thing together.

This tool does not provide editor facility (and will never) and will
not checked if the BibTeX file is correctly written.


HOW DOES IT WORKS?
------------------

Well, I try to apply KISS method. Hope it works and it is not too dirty. :)

The directory structure of the tool is:
	
	admin => stores tools (one for the moment) to create or
manipulate bibliographies
	xsl => stores XSLT stylesheets to translate into HTML or BibTeX
some references
	doc => some documentation
	bibs => directory where to put all bibliographies you want
	bibs/example => a directory example. It contains the
bibliography name 'example'.
	bibs/example/papers => to store electronic version of papers

All directories in bibs must have the same structure. For instance for
the bibliography 'example', the 'bibs/example' directory contains:
	* example.bib => the BibTeX file containing references
	* example.xml => XML traduction of the BibTeX file. This file
MUST(!!!) be writable for anyone so that it could be updated through
the web interface.
	* description.txt => a brief description of this
bibliography('My own very personal biblio' for instance)
	* papers/ => the directory where to put local electronic version of
references.

If you want to put more than one BibTeX file, it is possible. The tool
will then use their name to create corresponding groups. See BibTeX
section for more details.


INSTALLATION
------------

As the tool is based on PHP, XML, XSL and CSS ensure that :
	* XSL functions are activate in your PHP(>=4.0.3)
configuration (xslt.so)
	* You have a CSS2 compliant web browser so that the interface
behaves "normally"

Now decompress the archive in any web accessible place (for instance
~/public_html, /var/www or anywhere you want).

...and it should work.

Ensure that all XML files are writable (chmod a+w) for anyone if you want to be
able to update references through the web interface.


BIBTEX - XML
------------

Well, the only thing to do is to write your BibTeX file.

The tool has a PHP script to translate a BibTeX file into an XML
file. Briefly, it translates:
	* @atype{id, into an <bibentry type='atype' id='anid'> tag.
	* key = { data } into  an <key>data</key> tag. ( " are also
recognized, and multiple lines data too)

Warning!! the script does not transform LaTeX code and do not
interpret BibTeX constants. It also does not transform authors name
and lastname.

Some additional BibTeX fields have been added:

	* TXTAUTHOR: if present will be used as author data (for
instance if AUTHOR contains LaTeX code or mutliple lastname)
	* TXTTITLE: if present will be used as title
	* ABSTRACT: abstract of the paper
	* GROUP: for classification purpose for a single bibfile
bibliography. If more than two bibfile, the GROUP tag takes its value from the
name of the bibfile.
	* KEYWORDS: paper's keywords
	* URL: link to the ps version of the paper
	* URLZIP: link to the ps.gz version of the paper
	* PDF: link to the pdf version of the paper

In URL, URLZIP, PDF, only the filename is needed. It will look for papers in the
paper directory.

TODO
----

Well, certainly some bugs to resolve, and some CSS work to have
something "browser independent" unless they all comply to W3C standards.

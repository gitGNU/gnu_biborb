<span class='biborb'>BibORB</span> is a tool to manage and consult BibTeX bibliographies using a web
browser.

<p> The main aims in its design were to allow sharing of
bibliographies on a local network and accessing easily electronic releases of 
papers. It grew from this to permit; creation and deletion of bibliographies, 
then the facilities to edit BibTeX entries were added thus creating a simple 
web front-end to BibTeX.  </p>

<span class='biborb'>BibORB</span> presently supports: 
<ul>
    <li> Extensive functions via the web based interface including:
   	<ul>
		<li> Import your existing .bib files </li>
		<li> Create new bibliographies </li>
		<li> Delete bibliographies </li>
		<li> Export bibliography as plain text .bib file </li>
		<li> View different bibliographies </li>
		<li> Browse bibliography entries </li>
		<li> Create new bibliography entries </li>
		<li> Delete bibliography entries </li>
		<li> Upload further information on bibliography entries to
		the server (including electronic releases of papers in .ps, 
                .ps.gz or .pdf)
                </li>
		<li> Create a link to another website with information
		about the bibliography entry </li>
		<li> Create a link to more information about the
		bibliography entry on the server </li>
		<li> Search your bibliography (by authors, keywords or titles)</li>
		<li> Select a subset of a bibliography by groups </li>
                <li> Select a subset of a bibliography matching a search query</li>
		<li> Select subset of bibliography by shopping basket
		function </li>
                <li> Export the basket to plain text .bib file </li>
                <li> Export the basket to a simple HTML output </li>
	</ul>
    </li>

    <li> You can also use your favorite text editor to edit the bib file and
    then click on Update from BiBTeX to update the database. This bibliography can
    then be browsed etc. as above.
    </li>
</ul>

<span class='biborb'>BibORB</span> does not support:
<ul>
    <li>Concurrent access to the database. It has not
    been designed so that different users may 'safely' modify the same
    bibliography.</li>
    <li>The use of @string or @preamble </li>
</ul>

<p><span class='biborb'>BibORB</span> also provides a basic authentication method based on databases to
restrict write access to bibliographies.  </p>

BibORB is a tool to manage and consult BibTeX bibliographies using a web browser.

<p>

</p>

BibORB supports to way of use: 
<ul>
    <li>all actions using the web interface</li>
    <li>edition of the bibtex file "by hand" using your favorite text editor, and consultation using the web interface.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style='color:red;'>IMPORTANT!</span> Presently, BibORB has not been designed so that different users may 'securely' modified the same bibliography. Concurrent access is not supported. (may be in a latter version)

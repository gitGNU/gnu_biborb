<p>
The manager allows to create or delete bibliographies.
</p>

<h3>Create</h3>
<p>
    Biborb will create any necessary files to store the bibliography.
</p>

<h3>Delete</h3>
<p>
    Biborb will move the selected bibliography in the <code>bibs/.trash</code> directory. The bibliography will be removed from the list of available bibliographies.<br/>
    
    In order to definitively remove it, the <code>bibs/.trash</code> has to be cleaned manually.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
	BibORB is based on PHP, XML, XSL and use web pages formated using XHTML/CSS
standards. Consequently, you should ensure that:

	* PHP (>=4.0.3) is installed on your webserver.
	* PHP XSLT functions are available.
    * PHP Pear functions are available.
	* MySQL or any other database if you wish to use authentication.


PHP XSLT
--------
    It appears that XSLT support is not always enabled in some PHP distributions.
You will have to check that PHP is compiled with the option --with-sablot or
--with-xslt-sablot. http://www.php.net/xslt is a good starting point to get
information on the install process. Various linux distibutions also provide this
support by a php package (php4-xslt on debian for instance)
    Once XSLT support is enabled, you'll have to activate XSLT module in the 
configuration of PHP (php.ini):
        - on *nix add (or uncomment) the line:
            extension=xslt.so
        - on Windows add (or uncomment) the line:
            extension=php_xslt.so

PHP PEAR
--------
    PHP Pear package may be available on your OS distributions. Otherwise
http://pear.php.net/ provides instructions to install it on your system.


UPGRADE
-------
    When upgrading from a previous version:
    
    1. Rename the biborb directory:
        mv biborb biborb.old
    
    2. Untar the archive: tar -xvzf biborb-x.tar.gz
    
    3. Copy (or move) biborb.old/bibs to the new biborb directory.

INSTALLATION
------------

    1. Untar the archive: tar -xvzf biborb-x.tar.gz to your webserver's document
root (/var/www for instance) or your personal web directory ( ~/public_html for
instance)

    2. Make the "bibs" directory writable by the webserver. You can:
        - change its group to the webserver's group and give this group write 
        access to "bibs":
            chgrp www-data bibs
            chmod g+w bibs
        
        - or allow anyone to have a write access (not recommended for security
        reasons)
            chmod a+w bibs

    3. Edit the "config.php" file and customize BibORB to feet your needs.


AUTHENTICATION
--------------

    At the moment, only MySQL is supported for authentication. The MySQL's 
structure for BibORB is given in "data/biborb.sql".
    
    If you need to restrict access to BibORB, you will have to:
        - set $disable_authentication to FALSE in "config.php"
        - configure the following variables in "php/auth.php"
            $host = "localhost";
            $dbuser = "biborb-admin";
            $pass = "biborbdev";
            $db = "biborb";
            $table = "biborb_users";
            $auth_table = "biborb_auth";
        - then add new user to the "biborb_users" table and restrict access 
foreach database in "biborb_auth"

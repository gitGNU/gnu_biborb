INSTALLATION
------------

As the tool is based on PHP, XML, XSL and CSS you shoule ensure that :
	* XSL functions are activate in your PHP(>=4.0.3)
configuration (xslt.so/xslt.dll)
	* You have a CSS2 compliant web browser so that the interface
behaves "normally"


    1. Decompress the archive in any web accessible folder (for
instance ~/public_html, /var/www or anywhere you want).

    2. Check that the directory "bibs" is writable by the group to
which belong the http server (www-data or www or apache ....).

If you want account management, set $disable_authentication to FALSE
in the config.php file. If you set it to TRUE, skip the next
paragraph.

Then the next step is to setup the database to activate account
management. You will have to create a new database called
"biborb". Then use the "biborb.sql" to create the table that will
store people who will be allowed to edit/add/modify the
bibliography. Last step is to edit the config.php script and adapt
variables to your configuration
($host,$dbuser,$pass,$db,$table). Finally, add needed account to the
database.
